Prelude library for Python
==========================
This library provides functional programming constructs from languages
such as Haskell and Scala, implemented using existing Python libraries
such as `abc` (_abstract base class_) as appropriate.

The intention is for this to complement the existing `functools` library,
not to replace it.

Installation
------------
This package will be posted on PyPI once it's ready
